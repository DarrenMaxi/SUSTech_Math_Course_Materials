<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>If we let <i>C</i><sub>n</sub> to denote the <i>n</i> by <i>n</i> matrices, with the same properties, then it is obviously clear that no exchange of rows can produce 1’s along the diagonal of <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>.</p> <p>Consider<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/924/924ff84a-a90f-4cea-9adf-53063214d4e8/4764-4.3-29P-i3.png" style="width: 62.25pt; height: 36pt" />. Exchanging first and second row gives all 1’s along the main diagonal.</p> <p>Consider<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/685/6852b9f9-929b-42bd-a038-4500a83d9fb3/4764-4.3-29P-i4.png" style="width: 78.75pt; height: 55.5pt" />. In order to have 1 in the first row and first column, we need to exchange first row and second row. This gives<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/19b/19bf2112-520b-4292-8a55-84990dc377ab/4764-4.3-29P-i5.png" style="width: 54pt; height: 55.5pt" />. Thus, we cannot have a 1 in the third row and third column. Thus, in case of <i>C</i><sub>3</sub> also, no exchange of rows can produce only 1’s along the main diagonal.</p> <p>Consider<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/1bf/1bf3f315-2219-435a-8793-be9295713948/4764-4.3-29P-i6.png" />. Exchange row 1 and row 2. Then exchange row 3 and row 4. This will make all 1’s along the main diagonal.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Let us show that if <i>n</i> is even, it is always possible to exchange rows to obtain all 1’s along the main diagonal. Exchange first row and second row. Then exchange third row and fourth row. Then exchange fifth row and sixth row. Continue this process and finally exchange <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/b0e/b0eb4179-e8a2-460f-8da8-dcd89d89f975/4764-4.3-29P-i7.png" style="width: 30pt; height: 16.5pt" />row and <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> row. This makes all 1’s along the main diagonal. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>When <i>n</i> is even, either it is divisible by 4 or it is not divisible by 4. Thus, we can write <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/21f/21fc2641-9fe3-4caa-98d6-44ae04f74c2f/4764-4.3-29P-i8.png" style="width: 33.75pt; height: 13.5pt" />or<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/9a1/9a15c394-5063-499d-9c1a-4fe3a94feae0/4764-4.3-29P-i9.png" style="width: 51pt; height: 13.5pt" />, where <i>k</i> is some integer.</p> <p>Consider the following:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/eea/eeaab9f4-142b-40e8-90bb-0cc8f82ea936/4764-4.3-29P-i10.png" style="width: 38.25pt; height: 63pt" /></p> <p>Thus, in such case, row exchange is done 2<i>k</i> number of times. That is, row exchange is done even number of times. Every row exchange changes the sign of the determinant. When row exchange is done even number of times, this is same as applying proper permutation to <i>C</i><sub>n</sub>. Since the value of the determinant will remain the same along with the sign (due to even number of exchanges), this is same as even permutation.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Consider the following:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/877/87730117-312c-4466-abda-a3def9055080/4764-4.3-29P-i11.png" style="width: 54.75pt; height: 63pt" /></p> <p>Thus, in such case, row exchange is done 2<i>k</i>+1 number of times. That is, row exchange is done odd number of times. Every row exchange changes the sign of the determinant. When row exchange is done odd number of times, this is same as applying proper permutation to <i>C</i><sub>n</sub>. Since the value of the determinant will remain the same but the sign will change (due to odd number of exchanges), this is same as odd permutation.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Thus, for <i>n</i> = 4, 8, 12,... we get even permutation and when <i>n</i> = 2, 6, 10,... we get odd permutation.</p> <p>It may be noted that when <i>n</i> is an odd number, there is no exchange of rows possible, due to which we can get all 1’s along the main diagonal.</p></div>
