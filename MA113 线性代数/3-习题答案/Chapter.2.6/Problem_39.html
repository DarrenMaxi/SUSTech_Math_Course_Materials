<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>If we keep the same basis vectors but put them in different order, the change of basis matrix <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/7a3/7a333a6d-be92-4538-adb8-4b6614c5ebb4/4764-2.6-39p-i1.png" />is a permutation matrix. If we keep the basis vectors in order but change then lengths, <i>M</i> is a positive diagonal matrix change by lengths.</p></div>
