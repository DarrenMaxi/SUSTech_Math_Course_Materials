<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Note that when the black starts playing, either one of the white pawns has come forward (by one or two places) or one of the white knights has come forward.</p> <p>Initially <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> start the game. Initially, <i>A</i> places forward one of its pawns. </p> <p>Before <i>B</i> could reply to this move, <i>C</i> places forward one of its knights. <i>D</i> places the same pawn (as that of <i>A</i>) forward. That is, <i>D</i> copies <i>A</i>’s move. Then <i>C</i> takes his knight back. So far <i>B</i> hasn’t made any move.</p> <p>Therefore, the situation on either boards is same. Only difference is that on one board, a white pawn is moved and on the other board, a similar black pawn is moved. </p> <p>Now both games start. Whatever move is made by <i>B</i>, it is copied by <i>C</i> and whatever move is made by <i>A</i>, it is copied by <i>D</i>.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>We have assumed that no strategy always wins for black. Therefore, if <i>B</i> loses the match <i>A</i>, then <i>C</i> cannot win against <i>D</i>. Thus, on one board black loses and on the other board black wins. </p> <p>Suppose <i>A</i> moves his knight first, then also <i>C</i> will place his knight forward. Then <i>D</i> will move his knight, copying <i>A</i>’s move. Again <i>C</i> will take his knight back. Just like the previous case, if <i>B</i> loses the match <i>A</i>, then <i>C</i> cannot win against <i>D</i>. Thus, on one board black loses and on the other board black wins. </p> <p>Therefore, our assumption that no strategy always wins for black is wrong. Therefore, it is <span style="border: 1px solid black;">not proved</span> that no strategy always wins for black.</p></div>
